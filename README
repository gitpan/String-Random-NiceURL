String-Random-NiceURL

This module allows you to create sparse and distributed IDs such as those used
for YouTube videos. It uses a modified base 64 character set but also makes
sure that the first and last chars of your ID are not the dash or underscore
characters (this helps some programs detect the URLs correctly).

Any length IDs (greater than two chars) can be created and could be used for
blog posts, short URLs, images or videos.

EXAMPLE

    id(2)  => 6p
    id(6)  => NIK_qV
    id(11) => 2qUROkj-1X6
    ...etc...

For each length (len), the number of combinations is 62^2 * 64^(len-2):

* length 2 => 3844
* length 3 => 246016
* length 4 => 15745024  (over 15 million combinations already)
* length 5 => 1.008e+09
* length 6 => 6.449e+10
* length 7 => 4.127e+12
* length 8 => 2.642e+14
* length 9 => 1.691e+16 (lots and lots)

Out of interest, YouTube use 11 chars (but also the first and last letters can
include dashes or underscores), so their total number of combinations is 64^11,
which is 7.379e+19. (For comparison, this module would produce 6.925e+19
combinations at 11 chars, so not much less but much nicer due to the
constrained first and last chars).
